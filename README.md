JavaSteg
========

A simple command line too for steganography, utilizing Java's built in libraries.

Requirements:
Java 6, and Ant.

Once you have all the java commands working (type java, javac to make sure they are found in your path)
and you have ant installed, you run ant from this directory. Running ant clean, removes all temporary files. 

Then you run the program you type the following:
java -jar dist/JavaSteg.jar

The program will output its help message to explain its usage.
